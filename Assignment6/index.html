        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Before writing essay on Pakistan, lets disucss its history first. Muslims of the subcontinent were not given
            the proper rights and were harassed for living according to the Islamic way. Pakistan was a dream for Allama
            Muhammad Iqbal that came true after many sacrifices and struggles of many Muslims.

            The major effort and struggle was of Quid e Azam M.A. Jinnah. This effort to get a separate country started
            when Muslims started facing persecution. The idea of two nation theory was presented that Muslims and Hindus
            are different nations that can’t live together peacefully.

            Quaid e Azam succeeded on 14 Aug 1947 when a new country known as Pakistan was formed. Initially, Bangladesh
            was a part of Pakistan, but due to the 1971 civil war and political problems, East Pakistan (Bangladesh)
            proclaimed its independence.

            When Pakistan got its independence, it faced several problems, such as unfair boundary distribution,
            economic problems, the Kashmir dispute, electricity problems, division of financial assets, etc. Karachi was
            chosen as the capital of Pakistan Quaid e Azam was the first governor-general, and Liaquat Ali Khan was the
            prime minister. </p>

        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>Pakistan is one of the lucky countries. It has all four seasons due to the location. Winter is from December
            to February, spring is from March to May, Summer is from June to September, and retiring monsoon or autumn
            is from October to November. This season and their time can differ according to the location, as Pakistan
            has all plains, plateaus, mountains, or hilly areas.

            Pakistan has several rivers; the longest is Indus; other rivers are Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Kabul.
            The amazing thing is that the coastal areas are normally dry and hot, whereas the lowland plains are cooler
            than coastal areas, and the uplands or Himalayas are much cooler than the plain; this means at the same
            time, all seasons can be seen in Pakistan. </p>
