1. **Pyramid Pattern Generation**: Different patterns, like a number pyramid with increasing digits, requiring nested loops and understanding of spacing.

2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Implementing the algorithm to find primes up to N, using loops to mark multiples.

3. **Matrix Transposition**: Using nested loops to transpose a matrix, handling rows and columns.

4. **Longest Balanced Substring**: Finding the maximum length of balanced parentheses in a string using loops and counters.

5. **Array Statistics Without Built-ins**: Calculating average, min, max without using array methods, just loops.

6. **Iterative Permutations**: Generating permutations iteratively for a small string, using loops instead of recursion.

Wait, the permutations problem might be a bit too much for someone at intermediate level, but maybe it's a good challenge. Alternatively, a problem that requires checking for anagrams using loops.

Alternatively, a problem that simulates a grid movement, like a robot moving and turning, tracked with loops.

Also, considering performance: like optimizing a loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.

Let me outline the problems with details:

**1. Advanced Pyramid Patterns**

Task: Create a function that generates a specific pyramid pattern based on input. For example, input 5 would produce a pyramid with numbers increasing and arranged in a certain way. This requires nested loops and understanding how to manage row and column relationships.

**2. Prime Number Sieve**

Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes to list primes up to N. This requires understanding loops within loops and efficient marking of non-primes.

**3. Matrix Transposition**

Write a function to transpose a given N x M matrix using nested loops, without using any built-in methods like map. Handling 2D arrays and indices.

**4. Balanced Parenthesis Substring**

Given a string of parentheses, find the length of the longest balanced substring using a single loop and tracking counters.

**5. Array Statistics with Loops**

Process an array of numbers to find average, min, max without using reduce or Math functions, just loops. Forces manual tracking of variables.

**6. Iterative String Permutations**

Generate all permutations of a string using only loops, not recursion. This is challenging but possible with iterative approaches.
